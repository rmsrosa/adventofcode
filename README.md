# Advent of Code

My solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenge.

## AOC 2020

Folder [aoc2020](aoc2020/) contains the solutions to [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020). All done with [The Julia Programming Language](https://julialang.org/) (version 1.5.3), as a means of learning it better. It was my first year coding in Julia and it was a wonderful learning experience.

I used [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com), with the [Julia Language extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=julialang.language-julia).

Helpful discussions along the way with the nice people at the [Humans of Julia](https://discord.com/invite/C5h9D4j) server on [Discord](https://discord.com), over the channels `#advent-of-code` and `#aoc-spoilers`.

## AOC 2021

Folder `[aoc2021](aoc2021/) contains the ongoing solutions to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021). I probably won't have the same drive as last year's, but I will give it a try.
