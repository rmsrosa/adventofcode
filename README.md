# Advent of Code 2020

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

All done with [The Julia Programming Language](https://julialang.org/) (version 1.5.3), as a means of learning it better.

I used [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com), with the [Julia Language extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=julialang.language-julia).

Helpful discussions along the way with the nice people at the [Humans of Julia](https://discord.com/invite/C5h9D4j) server on [Discord](https://discord.com), over the channels `#advent-of-code` and `#aoc-spoilers`.
